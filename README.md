# Automated-Ambient-System-AAS-
In our project an Automated Ambient System(AAS) is introduced that controls AC units and light systems. The systems are classified as a hybrid system as there are time-driven continuous processes and event-based discrete events. Concurrent states will be defined between sensing and actuation for processes.

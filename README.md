### Warehouse automation is the process of automating the movement of inventory into, within, and out of warehouses to customers with minimal human assistance. As part of an automation project, a business can eliminate labor-intensive duties that involve repetitive physical work and manual data entry and analysis.

### For example, a warehouse worker may load an autonomous mobile robot with heavy packages. The robot moves the inventory from one end of the warehouse to the shipping zone and software records the movement of that inventory, keeping all records current. These robots improve the efficiency, speed, reliability, and accuracy of this task. But warehouse automation does not require physical or robotic automation, and in many cases simply refers to the use of software to replace manual tasks. However, this scenario illustrates how robots and humans work together to accomplish repetitive tasks while minimizing fatigue and injury.

### In an automated warehouse, not only machines and machine operations need to be automated, but also lights and
cooling need to be automated. In our project, an Automated Ambient System (AAS) is introduced that controls
AC units and light systems. The system is classified as a dynamic hybrid concurrent system as there are time-driven and event-driven processes making it a hybrid system and a model for controlling the central condition unit is used to implement continuous real-time control. Concurrent states will be defined between the light and AC systems as well as between sensing and actuation for the systems. Emergency states are studied in case of any fires or hazards in the warehouse. Light and AC systems are controlled in a concurrent system.
